        Measures of Central tendency

Distribution: in the process of analysis, we 
first collect the data. Data typically is a
group of observations for one or more variables
if one simply arranges the values associated with 
a particular from lowest to highest , we get a distribution.


central tendency: [mean, median , mode]

mean--> controversial


the measure of central tendency is dependent upon 3 metrics.

1. mean
2. median
3. mode

mean is simply the arithmatic average of the distribution

mean gives the summary of the data but cannot express the 
variability present in data.

lowest 
highest

for example:
    
if your head in the oven and your feet is in the freezer, then
on average you are in comfortable


median is the score of the distribution that marks the
50% percentile.


percentile means that 50% of the scores in the 
distribution fall above the median and 50% fall
below it.

1 2 3 4 5 6 100

median = 4

1 2 3 4 5 6

median = 3.5

mode

mode simply indicates the value that occurs most number
of times in a distribution

1,1,1,2,2,2,23,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,55,,6,6,6,666,6,6,6,66,
7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,99,9,9,,99,10,101,101,1,

[1,1,1,3,4,2,5,7,7,7]

mode= 1,7

multimodal distributions: bimodal distributions.

if we encounter more than one frequent value in a distribution
we call it the multimodal distributions.
if there are exactly two values with highest equal count than
we can call the distribution as bimodal distribution.

skewed distribution

- positively skewed:(tail(highest))  mean>median
- negatievely skewed : tail(lowest)   mean<median

skewed: 
    
    when a distribution of observations has a high number of values
    clustered at one end of the distribution with relatievely fewer values
    spread out towards the other end of the distribution forming a tail.


positive skew: in a skewed distribution, when most of the observations
are clustered at the lower end of the distribution with few
observations creating a tail at the higher end of the distribution

negative skew: in a skewed distribution, when most of the observations
are clustered at the higher end of the distribution with few
observations creating a tail at the lower end of the distribution.
